BUILDING THE PROGRAM
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog5’
   
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog5’ at the command prompt after building the program

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
    This is a tempelated class, this Templated class allow to write C++ code that will work with any data type.
    It can allow any data type to be passed in
    as a parameter or to be returned by afunction. this templated class allows  any data type to be used by the class.
    This is especially important in Abstract Data Types (ADTs).  Basically, a data
    type becomes a formal parameter to the template code.
    this program is Graph type works for directed, undirected, weighted and unweighted graph
      
PROGRAM INPUT
	This program has default input already. no user input is required to run the program.   


PROGRAM OUTPUT
  All output is written to the screen.
   
   
PROGRAM DESIGN
   This Templated class cannot be compiled separately since the data type for the
  template would not be known. this has to be compiled in the file that uses it.
  Graph type objects is created and stored in vector.

PROGRAM TESTING
    This program was tested with different sets of data,
    checked for invalid index of vector, 
    checked for all types of graph.
    checked for exception handling.
    there are no any bugs in this program.
